# Glucose Sensor Data Analysis
In this project we tried to grasp the accuracy of a Blood Glucose Sensor by analysing its measurements.

The dataset contains 5041 Blood Glucose values for a patient measured by the [UVa T1DM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4454102/) simulator (one measurement per minute for 84 hours) as well as the corresponding sensor measurement.
